# Contribution Guide

If you have not yet read it, read the main [contribution guide](https://developers.hushchat.chat/developing/contrib/).

You can get started with HushChat for Web by following [the development guide on the repository](https://github.com/hushchat/for-web?tab=readme-ov-file#development-guide).

## Contribution Policy

Since this project is still heavily in development, things may change rapidly at little notice, so it's recommended that you join [the HushChat server](https://stt.gg/Testers) and [the HushChat development server](https://stt.gg/API) where you can talk in `#HushChat for Web` about this project.

If something is explicitly marked as 'help wanted', then you can likely just pick up the issue and contribute a PR, however, you should make sure to communicate this on the issue so others don't start on the same issue as you, causing issues later.

Otherwise, feel free to come ask about what you'd like to contribute and run it past a maintainer so that we can check if there are any potential conflicts.
